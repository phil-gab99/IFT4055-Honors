  abstract = {During the development of a software project, different developers
                  collaborate on creating and changing models. These models
                  evolve and need to be versioned. Over the past several years,
                  progress has been made in offering dedicated support for model
                  versioning that improves on what is being supported by
                  text-based version control systems. However, there is still
                  need to understand model differences in terms of the semantics
                  of the modeling language, and to visualize the changes using
                  its concrete syntax. To address these issues, we propose a
                  comprehensive approach—called DSMCompare—that considers both
                  the abstract and the concrete syntax of a domain-specific
                  language (DSL) when expressing model differences, and which
                  supports defining domain-specific semantics for specific
                  difference patterns. The approach is based on the automatic
                  extension of the DSL to enable the representation of changes
                  and on the automatic adaptation of its graphical concrete
                  syntax to visualize the differences. In addition, we allow for
                  the definition of semantic differencing rules to capture
                  recurrent domain-specific difference patterns. Since these
                  rules can be conflicting with each other, we introduce
                  algorithms for conflict resolution and rule scheduling. To
                  demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our
                  approach, we report on evaluations based on synthetic models
                  and on version histories of models developed by third
                  parties.}
